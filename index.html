    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the
      persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
    <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200
      square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much
      more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the
        park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span class="bold-text">current fire restrictions.</span></p>

        entrance fee</span> upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in advance).</p>
